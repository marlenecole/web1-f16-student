	<p>As a Graphic Designer, I believe I need a Portfolio Site. It's essential to be able to show the artwork and to be able to link my resume with a convenient source to show case the art work.

Iâ€™m going to try to create a minimalist site that has clickable buttons to specific pieces of artwork. I would like the home page to maybe have an image carousal featuring resent work. For each sub-page I would like there to be mostly images of the work and few words. I would also like each page to be clean with minimal color palette.</p>
