		Growing up in Chelsea, a city five minutes outside of Boston, Cole made the life desiciion to become a designer. Against all odds (that including a very doubtful Grandfather, an unsuportive School Sysytem, and the general consensus of Haters) she desided to go for it. 
		
		Fast forward to now, she wakes up at the crack of dawn (4:30 a.m.) to get to her morning classes at Massachusetts College of Art and Design. She commonly stayes up till One O'clock to work on her designs. 
		
		She has a dream. She has the will. And she's running for the finish line.
