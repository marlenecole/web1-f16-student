<h3>Clients Needs</h3>
<p>My client runs the "local" resturant El Chalan in East Boston and Lynn. He wants a website because he wants his customers to be able to see where his new resturant is and to explain why his food is special to his area. He belives his customers and new potential customers will view this website and view food they might want to order.
	
	The client wants a website to feature his resturant. He wants a home page that features his most famous dish, his logo and the name of the resturant. He also wants his navigation to have a menu link, map link, picture (of food and drinks) link. For his footer he wants links to his social media. 
	
	All in all, he wants a very simple website, for now, so that people can see the menu, the location and pictures of the food. Nothing over the top.
