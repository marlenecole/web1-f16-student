	Twenty years ago in a family kitchen, there was a Mother, her two Sons, and their Aunt. Together they cooked and and tested and tried to come up with the pefect recipe for Chicken. Eventually it happened. BUt it was missing something, but they couldn't figure out what it was. Eventually the father of the second Sons Wife concocted a sauce made from a secret ingredient that would eventually be known as the "Green Sauce". Today, the Chicken and Green Sauce is a staple in the fabric of El Chalan. It has brought so many customers there and it always leaves them happy.
