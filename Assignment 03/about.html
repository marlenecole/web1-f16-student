	I've been drawing since the day I could hold a pencil, and started teaching myself to draw digitally in 2003. Although I was born in <em>Holland</em> and have dutch nationality, I've lived all over the world, including the United States, Indonesia, France and Belgium. Upon finishing high school in 2004, I studied animation in <em>Ghent</em> (Belgium) for a year and then moved back to my home country to study animation at the <em>Hogeschool voor de Kunsten Utrecht</em> (HKU) in Hilversum. I am currently a freelance illustrator and animator located in Utrecht (the Netherlands) and living with my boyfriend and fellow animator Arjen Klaverstijn.
